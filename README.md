# Social-Media-Login
Creates an application that automates login for Instagram, Facebook, Reddit and GitHub. The application makes use of the kivy and selenium packages.

I chose to not use kv files so that I could get a better understanding of the widget tree system that kivy utilizes. I thought that this approach would allow me to later apply the skills I learnt to different OOP languages.
